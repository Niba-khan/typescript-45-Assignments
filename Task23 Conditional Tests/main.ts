/*Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:

let car = 'subaru';

console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")

console.log(car == 'subaru')

• Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.

• Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False/*/


// Making vaiable
let six = 6;

let nine = 9;

//Test 1
console.log("Test1: six is equal to 6?");
console.log(six == 6);

//Test 2
console.log("\nTest2: nine is equal to 9?");
console.log(nine == 9);

//Test 3
console.log("\nTest3: nine is greather then 6");
console.log(nine > 6);

//Test 4
console.log("\nTest4: nine is not equal to 6");
console.log(nine != 6);

//Test 5
console.log("\nTest5: six is less then 9");
console.log(six < 9);

//Test 6
console.log("\nTest6: nine is equal to 6");
console.log(nine == 6);

//Test 7
console.log("\nTest7: six is greather then 9");
console.log(six > 9);

//Test 8
console.log("\nTest8: nine is less then 6");
console.log(9 < 6);

//Test 9
console.log("\nTest9: six is not equal to 6");
console.log(six != 6);

//Test 10
console.log("\nTest10: nine is greather then 9");
console.log(nine > 9);
